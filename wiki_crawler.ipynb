In one semifinal, fourth place Canada faced first-place [[USSR]], who were a perfect 5–0 in the round-robin.

Matai's second sideline conversion attempt missed, so Manly were leading 18 - 0.

In the seventy-second minute the Manly side ran the ball down toward the left corner with Robertson passing back in to Steve Menzies, who was playing in his 349th and final NRL match to crash over for a try, his 180th. Jamie Lyon took over the goal kicking and converted Menzies' try to give Manly a 34 - 0 lead. However, the finale was to come at the seventy-five-minute mark when from their forty-metre line, Manly second rower Glenn Hall burst into open space, passing back inside for Brett Stewart who was running through in support. Stewart was chased down just short of the try-line by Storm halfback Cooper Cronk, but he managed to flick the ball back without looking into the arms of Steven Bell to also get a try in his last game at the club.

Regular right wing Ben Smith was used to cover Dagg's injuries and played so well that he took the fullback jersey for the first two Bledisloe tests. Dagg was the given another shot against Argentina in his home province and played well enough to shift Smith back to right wing for the rest of the rugby championship. Against England on the end of year tour, Dagg got shown up on defence by [[Jonny May]] and lost his fullback spot to Smith for the last test against Wales.\n",

Pavelski trailed by four points back and [[Anaheim Ducks]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|left wing]] [[Alex Killorn]] trailed Pavelski by two. Curry topped his performance on Saturday, July 15, in Round Two, with a hole-in-one on the seventh hole.

Fish claimed the lead and held it for most of the back nine. Fish held a three-point lead over Curry going into the 18th and final hole. The tournament finish was controversial because a fan interrupted the outcome. As Fish approached the tee box, a heckler yelled at him &quot;Hey, Fish, f––– you, you suck!&quot; The heckler then screamed bird noises right in his backswing as Fish hooked it to the right in the trees. The fan tried to scurry away and was tracked down by Curry and Fish's caddies as well as Stephen's father, [[Dell Curry]], who regularly plays in the tournaments with his sons and was previously Stephen's caddie in the past. It was later revealed that the fan had money on Curry to win the tournament. Fish had to settle for par. Curry won the tournament by making an essential clutch eagle for a walk-off win. Had he missed the putt, he would have lost. He finished the event with 75 points, three more points than Fish and nine more points than Pavelski. He became the first active player to win the event since Del Greco in 2000 (fifth total), the second in basketball to win it, and the first African-American to win the event.\n",

The Flames jumped out to a 3–0 lead in Game 7, and the Oilers called an early timeout, during which Tikkanen chewed out the entire bench. Inspired by the speech, Edmonton fought back and ended up winning 5–4 in overtime on a wrist-shot from Tikkanen on his off-wing. It was Tikkanen's third goal of the game, and seventh of the series. The Oilers had suffered several injuries in the series with Calgary, and they met Los Angeles in the next round. The first three games of the series were all decided in overtime, and the Oilers held a 3–2 series lead heading into Game 6 at Northlands Coliseum. The Oilers again won in overtime, on the heroics of Craig MacTavish. In the Campbell Conference Finals against the Minnesota North Stars, the Oilers ran out of gas: after splitting the first two games in Edmonton, the North Stars won both games on home ice: the Stars repeatedly slashed Messier on his injured hand, though no penalties were called. Game 5 in Edmonton was close, but the Stars prevailed 3–2 to win the series 4–1 and go to the Stanley Cup Finals. Tikkanen led the team in scoring in the playoffs with 10 goals and 20 points. First-year Oilers [[Anatoli Semenov]] and [[Norm Maciver]] proved to be revelations in the playoffs. Semenov finished with 10 points in 12 playoff games, and Maciver led the team with a +10 in 18 playoff games.\n",

Kicking duty was handed to Steve Matai who coolly converted Robertson's try from next to the sideline, bringing his side's lead to 14–0. Three minutes later, and from a similar attacking position, the Sea Eagles kept the ball alive, a pass from Brett Stewart fifteen metres out arriving at the feet of Steve Matai who, with only one defender before him, picked it up and passed to Michael Robertson to dive over again in the same corner. Matai's second sideline conversion attempt missed, so the Sea Eagles were leading 18–0.

Ten minutes later the Sea Eagles got another try when, from within the Storm's ten-metre line, they moved the ball out to David Williams on the right wing to dive over in the corner. The conversion attempt by Matai went wide so the Sea Eagles were leading 28–0. In the seventy-second minute the Sea Eagles ran the ball down toward the left corner with Robertson passing back in to Steve Menzies, who was playing in his 349th and final NRL match to crash over for a try, his 180th. Jamie Lyon took over the goal kicking and converted Menzies' try to give Manly a 34–0 lead. However, the finale was to come at the seventy-five-minute mark when from their forty-metre line, Sea Eagles second rower Glenn Hall burst into open space, passing back inside for Brett Stewart who was running through in support. Stewart was chased down just short of the try-line by Storm halfback Cooper Cronk, but he managed to flick the ball back without looking into the arms of Steven Bell to also get a try in his last game at the club.
